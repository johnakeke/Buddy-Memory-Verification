\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this paper, we have presented a specification for buddy allocation algorithms with two services for the allocation and disposal of memory blocks. Then we specify and prove a number of properties for functional correctness of the specification. After that, we introduce integrity property for the security assurance of this specification. To achieve this goal, we design a state-machine security model with the concepts of interfering and state equivalence. Through Instantiating this security model by adding interface functions to buddy allocation specification, we finally prove that the instantiation security model satisfies integrity property.

In the next step, we will add some implements like real address spaces, multilevel free linked-list and multilevel free bitmap to this buddy allocation specification to form a design-level specification. And further, we are going to extend this work to an implementation-level specification by semantics languages. In these processes, refinement technology is necessary to guarantee between two adjacent level specifications.
