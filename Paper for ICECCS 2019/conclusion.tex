\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this paper, we have presented a specification for buddy allocation algorithms with two services for the allocation and disposal of memory blocks. Then we specify and prove the necessary properties for functional correctness of the specification regarding the blocks allocated and disposed and the structure of the memory layout. After that, we introduce integrity property for the security assurance of this specification. To achieve this goal, we design a state-machine security model with the concepts of interfering and state equivalence. Through instantiating this security model by adding interface functions to the buddy allocation specification, we finally prove that the instantiation security model satisfies integrity property.

As future work, we plan to extend the current model with real address spaces, multilevel free linked-list and multilevel free bitmap to this buddy allocation specification to provide a design-level specification. Furthermore, we are planning to extend this work to an implementation-level specification using a modelling language able to capture the semantic of system programming languages. In this process, refinement is necessary to guarantee property preservation between two adjacent level specifications.
